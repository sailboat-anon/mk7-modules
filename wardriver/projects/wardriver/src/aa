MVP:
- nicer messages
-- remind the user we need a min to warm-up in the beginning of a new cycle
- turn-off scan on TOGGLE-off
- MUCH larger status window.  should auto-scroll to bottom
- ensure handshakes are new (and not repeating)
- moving cardbar footer
- 2 charts (chart.htm)

WHEN SCAN IS IN PROGREESS
- when toggle status is checked, update berker too ()
